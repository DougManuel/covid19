
Tabulation of Canadian provincial age group sizes based on Census 2016 of Canada
================================================================================

This task generates two CSV files, each of which is a tabulation of the Canadian
provincial age group sizes based on Census 2016 of Canada.
The bin sizes of the two discretizations by age are respectively 1 and 5.

These group sizes are input data needed to compute social mixing matrices for
the Canadian provinces.

The social mixing matrices are in turn required information for computing
weighted infection fatality ratio estimates for the Canadian provinces.

The required data were downloaded from the following Statistics Canada URL
